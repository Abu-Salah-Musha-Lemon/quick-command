üîç 1. Check for Device Installation/Removal Logs(windows  powercell)
```bash
Get-WinEvent -LogName System | Where-Object {    $_.Id -eq 20001 -or $_.Id -eq 20003 } | Select-Object TimeCreated, Id, Message | Format-Table -AutoSize
```
Event IDs:

<br>20001 ‚Äì New device installed
<br>20003 ‚Äì Device removed
###üîß 2. Audit Plug and Play Events
```bash
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Microsoft-Windows-DriverFrameworks-UserMode/Operational'; ID=1003} |   Select-Object TimeCreated, Message
```
###üß† 3. Query Installed Hardware with WMI
```bash
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_PnPEntity | Select-Object Name, Manufacturer, DeviceID
```
### üßæ 4. Export Full Hardware Snapshot (Before/After Comparison)
```bash
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_PnPEntity | Export-Csv "hardware_snapshot.csv" -NoTypeInformation
```
üõ°Ô∏è Bonus: Setup Hardware Change Auditing (Windows Only)
Enable hardware change auditing through Group Policy:<br>

Run
```bash gpedit.msc```

Go to Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration<br>

Enable:<br>
<br>
Audit System Events
<br>
Audit Plug and Play Events
<br>
You can then view these in Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc).<br>
###Create a Baseline and Compare
Save current hardware info:
```bach
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_PnPEntity | Export-Csv "C:\hardware_snapshot.csv" -NoTypeInformation
```
Later, run it again and compare files using:
```bach
Compare-Object (Import-Csv "hardware_snapshot.csv") (Import-Csv "C:\new_snapshot.csv")
```
